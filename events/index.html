The event, sponsored by eSentire and hosted by Phil Skelton, focused on the evolving cybersecurity landscape, emphasizing the integration of advanced technologies like AI and machine learning in Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services.\n\nDuring my talk, I highlighted the critical need for strategic partnerships to address the rising sophistication of cyber threats and the cybersecurity skill gap. I discussed how MSPs can leverage collaborations with specialized providers to enhance their service offerings and meet regulatory compliance requirements, such as GDPR and NIS2.\n\nThe round table also provided a platform for discussing the challenges of differentiating services in a competitive market and the importance of investing in cybersecurity infrastructure. I shared insights on how digital transformation and regulatory pressures are driving the demand for robust cybersecurity measures.\n\nOverall, the event underscored the importance of innovation and collaboration in navigating the complexities of the cybersecurity market, offering valuable insights into future trends and strategic opportunities.\n\nSince this was top executives round table, for privacy reason I will not share pictures from inside the round table event.\n\n[Read the full event report here](https://www.iteuropa.com/sites/default/files/leaders-in-discussion/files/esentire_european_executive_forum_feb_22.pdf)\n\n`Some pictures during the event`\n\n![Discussion at Pulitzer Hotel](/images/blog/2023-10-26-Pulitzer-EuropeanExecutiveForum/Abdessamad_26102023_003.jpg)\n8:T94c,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\nI'm happy to share about the amazing workshops we recently held in Morocco. My amazing colleague Kim Frellsen joined me as we met with teams from INWI and Orange, along with our great local Fortinet team. Together, we explored some really exciting developments in technology and security.\n\n## 5G Security: Building a Safer Future\n\n5G is changing everything in telecom, and that means we need to think differently about security. Kim kicked things off by sharing some really important points:\n\n- What makes 5G networks more vulnerable to attacks and why we need to pay attention\n- Smart ways to keep 5G infrastructure safe and prevent security problems\n- How Fortinet's security tools can help protect these modern networks\n\n## Deep Packet Inspection (DPI): Insights into Network Traffic\n\nI got to dive deep into the latest TLS developments and the challenges telecom operators face with DPI. If you're curious about these challenges, check out our webfiltering writeup or the TLS ECH animation.\n\n(Note: Some details about our DPI solution are Fortinet proprietary, so I can't share everything here.)\n\n## Quantum Computing and Cryptography: Preparing for the Next Era\n\nQuantum computing is going to change cybersecurity in big ways. We talked about:\n\n- Where quantum computing is now and where it's heading\n- How it might affect our current encryption methods\n- Ways we can prepare by using quantum-resistant encryption\n\n## Fortinet: A Trusted Partner in Security\n\nThroughout our sessions, we showed how Fortinet can help:\n\n- Creating security solutions specifically for telecom companies\n- Sharing real examples of our technology making a difference\n- Showing how we're ready to tackle new challenges in 5G, DPI, and more\n\n## Working Together for the Future\n\nThese workshops were about more than just sharing information - they were about working together to build something better. By talking directly with the people running these networks, we could help Moroccan telecom operators prepare for what's coming next in our digital world. It was great to share ideas and think about solutions together.\n\nThank you to everyone who helped make these workshops so successful, especially Youness Fikhar our main local SE in the telco market, Youssef Fouzi our great Morocco country manager, Mohammed El Kadiri, and all local Fortinet team. \n\nLooking forward to our next collaboration!\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"9:T64c,\n\n\nI had the privilege of speaking at a our yearly SME event held at the Mouratoglou Hotel in Sophia Antipolis, France. \n\nThis event brought together leading experts in the field of cybersecurity, and I was honored to contribute to the discussions with my insights and experiences.\nDuring the sessions, I delved into the intricacies of low-level traffic generation within the cybersecurity industry. My presentation focused on advanced techniques for performance enhancement, specifically utilizing kernel netmap and DPDK. These tools are pivotal in optimizing network performance and ensuring robust security measures.\n\nFurthermore, I explored the power of Unix systems in simulating complex telecommunications scenarios. This included demonstrations on simulating GTPv1, 5G PFCP, and other cutting-edge technologies. These simulations are crucial for testing and validating security protocols in real-world telco environments.\nThe event was a fantastic opportunity to share knowledge and engage with fellow professionals who are equally passionate about advancing cybersecurity technologies.

This year was no exception, and I had the privilege of leading some in-depth sessions on critical topics, including the often-overlooked gray areas of Quality of Service (QoS) and solutions validation.\n\nHere are some of the main topics I wanted to highlight\n\n## Session1: Telco and QoS challenges\n\nThe session on QoS was particularly rewarding. We delved into complex traffic flows, explored the intricacies of chip-level processes, we also tackled kernel QoS, design strategies, and common pitfalls. \n\nThe Fortinet System Engineers were highly engaged, peppering me with questions throughout the session. What truly stood out was the overwhelming response afterward—many engineers approached me to discuss their challenging QoS projects  in the Telco market or upcoming initiatives that needed to address QoS issues. This enthusiasm has inspired me to consider writing a more  internal comprehensive document on the subject.\n\n## Session2: Fortinet solutions validation and return on experience\n\nThe solutions validation session was equally exciting. I had the pleasure of collaborating as speaker with Simon Bryden, who shared brilliant insights from our experiences in solutions validation and testing. We concluded the discussion with some entertaining anecdotes from the field, providing a light-hearted yet informative end to the workshop.\n\nBelow are some photos capturing the energy and engagement of the event.\n\nI blured parts of the pic that might have some internal FTNT info\n\n## Session3: cFOS in standalone docker and Kubernetes\n\nThis wasnt a one I gave directly, but I tried to actively participate and help audience with the brilliant handson lab done by Kim Frellesen, the session highlights the latest containernised Fortinet solution (cFOS) aka container Fortigate, in typical docker or kubernetes deployements..\n\n\n`here are pictures from the event, internal infos on slides are blured, and last pic is right before our return flight to Amsterdam from Nice with my colleague and good friend Adel El Adham`\n\n![Going through some deep Fortigate flows](/images/blog/2024-11-05-telco-workshop-nice-france/pic1.jpeg)\n*Going through some deep Fortigate flows*\n\n![Internal QoS and chips](/images/blog/2024-11-05-telco-workshop-nice-france/pic2.jpeg)\n*Internal QoS and chips*\n\n![More QoS](/images/blog/2024-11-05-telco-workshop-nice-france/pic3.jpeg)\n*More QoS internal flows*\n\n![Leaving Nice Airport right before return flight, with my colleague Adel](/images/blog/2024-11-05-telco-workshop-nice-france/pic4.jpeg)\n*Leaving Nice Airport right before return flight, with my colleague Adel*\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"b:T76e,\n\n# Digital Transformation in the Energy Sector Forum 2023\n\n\nOn June 5th, 2023, I had the privilege of speaking at a significant event in Amsterdam, focusing on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, and energy efficiency.
